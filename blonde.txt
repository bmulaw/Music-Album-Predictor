Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mine on the road
Your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari
Had a good time
Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari


Stick by me
Close by me
You were fine
You were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds
Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me
'Ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ah on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes


I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year, White Ferrari
Good times
In this life, life
In this life, life


One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
Mind over matter is magic
I do magic
If you think about it it'll be over in no time
And that's life
Ooh, oooh, oooh, ooh


I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us imprisoned
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam










Pool side convo about your summer last night, oh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mmm
Could I make it shine last night
Could I make it shine, on it last night, last night
Could we make it in? Do we have time?


I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right


Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me


Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never cause I made you use your self control
And you made me lose my self control, my self control


Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing


I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
(Nobody else, nobody else)
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it


















These bitches want Nikes (This is a setup)
They looking for a check (Oh my god)
Tell em it ain't likely (This bitch tryna set me up)
Said she need a ring like Carmelo (Hands up, oh my god)
Must be on that white like Othello (Oh my, it's a real life angel)
All you want is Nikes (Yeah)
But the real ones just like you (Tell these niggas)
Just like me (Tell these guys you ain't basic)


I don't play, I don't make time
(Tell these guys you wear Zanottis, you a hottie, this is heaven on earth)
But if you need dick I got you and I yam from the line
(But if you're in the party don't bring your shotty
Love everybody)
Pour up for A$AP (rest in peace)
RIP Pimp C (rest in peace)
RIP Trayvon, a nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
(Remember one thing, remember one thing: don't take no photos in the party)
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
(That's rule number one
Rule number two: don't take no photos in the party)
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
(Rule number three: I got one left)
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath
Weighted down
(If you in the-)
Punk madre, punk papa
(If you couldn't get to the-, go your ass to sleep, we in the-)
He don't care for me
(Special shoutout to them live niggas at Rap-A-Lot records)
But who cares for me
(We keep it hot)
And that's good enough
(I've been working on my bod, I feel hot)
We don't talk much or nothin'
(If we in the- holla at ya gwalla)
But when we talkin' about something
(Oh my god, hold up)
We have good discussion
(Tell these basic bitches we don't wear Nike)
I met his friends last week, feels like they're up to something
(You guys are naughty, you a hottie, hold up)
That's good for us


We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles in the glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
The only human in this humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking in my jeans
We breathin pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'


I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too










































I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for ya
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)


Wishing you Godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always


(This love will keep us still blinded of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
Until the time...
(This love will keep people blinded of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
'Till the time we die...
(This love will keep us still blinded by the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)


Oh-oh, ohhh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh
























That's the way everyday goes
Every time we have no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Half way on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
So I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool in this good life
Won't let you down when it's all ruined


Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here


In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nose dive in the flood lines
Tall tower, milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannon ball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (you showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it up when the sun is ruined


That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here




Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality










I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing new
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good


If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then
Back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends


I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing new
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good


In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to... meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivy's illegal
Don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good


I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
Had no chance to prepare
Couldn't see you coming
And we started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good


All the things I didn't mean to say
I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
Did you mean to? Me too
I've been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you
I've been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you
I've been dreaming
Dreaming
