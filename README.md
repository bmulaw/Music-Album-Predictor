# Music-Album-Predictor
If you could go back in time and listen to your favorite album for the first time, would you be able to tell if a psuedo-song is actually a part of that album or not?


This is a statistical modelling python code that can make a reasonably accurate prediction on where a given music is likely to have come from between two given albums. 
It analyzes texts and uses Naive Bayes Classification model to make its prediction.

For fun, I have provided two of my favorite albums by Frank Ocean: Blonde and Channel Orange. In those txt files, you can find six selected songs from 
Blonde: {White Ferrari, Self Control, Nike, Godspeed, Pink + White, and Ivy} and 
Channel Orange: {Thinkinâ€™ Bout You, Sweet Life, Forrest Gump, Lost, Bad Religion, and End}. 

I then provided three songs to test the accuracy of the model (Pyramid from Channel Orange, Sierra Leone from Channel Orange, and Nights from Blonde). The algorithm
works well enough to correctly determine which album those three songs are from. 

I have also attached Prince's Purple Rain, and Bryson Tiller's Trapsoul albums. Feel free to try out your own txt files of different albums and test if the model can determine which
album the excluded song belongs to; or to test where it would think a song from a different album would fit into.


Jam on!
