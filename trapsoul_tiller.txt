Oh you told me, girl you told me
Could've sworn that you told me
Well, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you

Let me show you the difference
I just want you to listen now
(Yeah, I love you, I love you)
I just want you to listen now
(Yeah, I love you, I love you)
Can you tell the difference?
No, you can tell the difference
Oh yes, I say, with me it's different
Baby, I know you see the difference






Girl nah
Right now
You are now tuned in
Pen Griffey
I'm still going in
“Who is he?”
Mothafucka’ I’m him (Yeah, let’s get it)




I'm comin' back for good
So let them niggas know it's mine
“I already got someone” is what you tell 'em every time
That shit ain't up for grabs
Where you at on the map?
I come to where you at
Fuck around and end up your last
I won't hold back, yeah
I won't hold back, this time
I won't hold back (I won't hold back)




It's about time I do it
It's about time I say this shit
Spent a lot of time on the waitin' list
Roll up the doja then blaze that shit
Who gonna give you lovin' the same as this?
A-game girl, I bring that shit
I know you want the same last name as him
Him bein' Tiller, he a solid young nigga
He been real ever since
I know you been tense
I know we ain't had a conversation in a minute
But you know what they say
If it ain't broken then don’t fix it
It's clearly not broken, it's just so unfinished
I feel like my new bitch was just your apprentice
And we just got into it, here comes the endin'
You said this shit would happen, girl, that was your prediction
Said I'll never find no one like you and I should have listened
Who you fucking with now is that any of my business?
Whoever it is may not be finished
But...


I'm comin' back for good
So let them niggas know it's mine
“I already got someone” is what you tell 'em every time
That shit ain't up for grabs
Where you at on the map?
I come to where you at
Fuck around and end up your last
I won't hold back




I hope you still feel the same way
Don't say the same shit to me, you'll never change




Oh yeah
I said it once, girl you so fine
Can we do it like old times?
Or nah, so fly
Oh why, didn't you
Tell me get my shit together and think it through?
A nigga just been sittin' here not knowin' what to do
Ayy, thinking shit like who's out there fucking you?
And who's keepin' you comfortable?




She gon' give me a second chance or nah?
Did I make you fall in love again or nah?
Fuck them other niggas, you're mine
Hey baby
Hey, girl




I'm so different
Nothin' like them other niggas
Nothin' like them other niggas
Nothin' like them other niggas

Niggas know it's mine...
Someone is what you tell 'em...
Every time
Every time
Every time...














This what happen when I think 'bout you
I get in my feelings, yeah
I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, fuck, I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord, please save her for me, do this one favor for me
I had to change my player ways, got way too complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say
That way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so (Yeah)




So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me




Break it down, yeah
Yes sir
Check




We used to lay up and then stay up
Have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just leveled-up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak, that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man, it's true, exes change, yeah
Ayy, guess you changed for the better (Better!)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so, so (Yeah)




So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me




For real shawty
You already know


Yeah, is you at Two Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just gettin' loose
Maybe I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
Won’t fuck you over, wanna fuck you over and again
The truth is I ain't really here to start problems
Girl, I swear to God them hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em, "don't try him"
I don't wanna tell 'em, let's surprise 'em
I don't wanna get into it – why you stressin' him? I've been drivin'
Back and forth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass in my grip
College make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl, I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say what's up with you?
You got my soul


























Bless up
There's some bad bitches out there that I really wanna sex up
They'll probably only let me fuck cause I'm next up
Got me feeling like a nigga now, yessir
Running through 'em, looking for a down bitch
It's like looking for them hitters on SoundClick
Hoping someone else ain't already killed it
Wait up, for real, you exclusive? I found it
Baby, say it's true
I don't wanna have to wait on you
These are things I gotta say to you
Make me feel irreplaceable, baby
Cause I can't call it
You fuck with other niggas, I won't even bother
Young poppa, tell 'em who taught you
Let me put my stamp on it, let me crop all them other niggas
Out the picture, I say fuck them other niggas
Won't you say it with me?
My homeboy left the crib to me, baby, you should stay with me
For as long as I'm here, baby that's okay with me
For as long you want, baby that's okay with me
For as long you want, baby that's okay with me


How does it sound? Sound?
Fuck it girl, come spend the night with me
Say whatever, just don't lie to me
Stepping out, know I want you on the side of me
Mama, you could come work, full-time with me
Roll through in the Bimmer, get inside
'Til the wheels fall off, that's how long you can ride with me
Yeah, that's word to Stephen Garrett, come ride with me
(Yeah yeah)
Say it one more time for you
These are things I gotta say to you
Make me feel irreplaceable
Yeah yeah
























Don't, don't play with her, don't be dishonest (Ayy)
Still not understandin' this logic (Ayy)
I'm back and I'm better (And I'm better)
I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, "Just listen"


Don't
Don't


Girl, said he keeps on playin' games
And his lovin' ain't the same
I don't know what to say, but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it 100, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feelin' this way
Givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh baby


Don't


H-Town got a nigga so throwed
Pour up, we can party some more
Yeah, got this drank in my cup
Got a young nigga feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
Young money got a nigga feelin' old
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
Ride paint and we sip 'til we fold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got a nigga so throwed


Don't








Fasho
So, ever since October
Living out my dreams and got a lot closer
Had to do it for my daughter before she got older
Had to wake the sleepers up, bitch I got Folgers
I'm the realest nigga out, remember I told ya
Yes I’m Derby city raised, but I’m not local
Now they actin' like they kin, I do not know them
I've been prospering ever since I dropped "Don't", nigga
But it don't stop here, I gotta keep it goin', keep it goin'
Keep that hate coming my nigga, I'ma keep ignoring
God Tiller, your flow so prehistoric
Got, got killer smoke yo it put me in a coma
I'm Cassius, my nigga put me in the corner
Versus anybody, really show me my opponent
They coming for my head, not like Makonnen
Kill them all, send 'em my condolences
And I'm back, back, back on my bullshit nigga
Do I miss doing this shit, just for fun? Just a little
Now, I do it for funds, that's facts, fundamentals
For a house up on the makers, lawyers, doctors, my neighbors
Everyday I say my prayers, terminating betrayers
Now the man is blessing me, first the man was testing me
I went through the storm not knowing whether it was green on the other side or not
That shit would bring out the best of me
I'm so true with it, who are you kidding?
12 asked what I do for a living, told them Google it
I'm so rude with it, and the youngest doing it
You don't know what I been through nigga
This the truth nigga, oh my goodness
Spittin' flames in the booth, nigga, oh my goodness
God really came through for me, oh my goodness
I can give a fuck about you, and your mothafuckin' crew
That's ain't something I would do, no I wouldn't
Ya dig?




Yeah
I just gotta let this shit ride man
(Ya dig?)
Uh, I feel like Weezy F Baby sometimes man
Carter 3 Wayne, Carter 4 Wayne
Carter 5, man where that shit at?
Yessir


You know me, I gotta keep it real on this shit
My shawty mama put me out the crib, nigga I was payin' bills
Almost got a third job, she don't know the way it feels
But look, look at how a nigga living
My dream just got a lot more vivid
And I'm starting to see a whole lot more friendlies
But I don't want too many, no I don't want too many, no way
City to city
Never forget that phone call I got from Timbo and Richie
When I was in Philly, that's when I knew this shit wasn't given
Then shit really got crazy, got the kicks from Drizzy
Well, the recognition from Drizzy alone
I remember when they slept on me: memory foam
Can't believe Timbo the king just sent me back home
But now that boy getting on, my nigga give me the throne
Ya dig?
Yup, I know the people they diggin' me now
The cool kids from high school can't sit with me now
My baby mama's mama can't say shit to me now
What did she do wrong? She better figure it out
You better, I done grew into a wise young fella
This is true shit, you know Tiller gon' tell 'em
I'll tell 'em the truth, I'll tell 'em the truth
I'll tell 'em the truth
The whole truth, yeah
I'll tell 'em the truth, I'll tell 'em the truth
I'll tell 'em the truth
The whole truth, ay, baby yeah






Baby sometimes I feel so naive
Thinking you would come back to me
Say I fucked up, I'd have to agree
But second chances I do believe in
Just give me one reason
We fight, make up then fuck
Girl that's the sequence
I've been dreaming about the most recent
I don't lie, no I don't pretend
And your guard up, that's defense
Let it down, girl I swear I won't let you down
I ain't 2Pac, don't get around
Was clueless at first but I get it now, I get it now
You know all of my secrets and
You know all of my weaknesses
I can't give that to someone else, none of these weak bitches
Gotta tell them hoes keep distance
Miss how you whisper go deep in it
Please don't do that with no one else
Just me, is that too much?


Is that too much? yeah
Is that too much? oh yeah yeah
Am I asking for too much?
Say this shit once, say this shit two times
I won't stop 'til I get back what's mine
I know I fucked up one too many times
Is that too much?


Truth be told I know that somebody
Somebody as real as me, someone as sincere as me
That's what I'm afraid of
Don't you dare give him the same love
Cause what that man do girl, I can do it
Hold up one time baby girl, I can prove it
But this right here, so time consuming
And this right here got my mind confusing
What now what now, one day one day you'll come around
Like "Fuck them niggas, I'll shut 'em down"
Sex Mami I'm needin' it
Thirsty much I gotta replenish
If I get it back you know I'm keepin' it
Baby, I been deep in my thoughts like






Is that too much? yeah
Is that too much? oh yeah yeah
Am I asking for too much?
I won't stop 'til I get back what's mine
I know I fucked up one too many times




This, uh

This-this is not, this-this is not a motherf-
A motherfucking game, motherfucker, this is not

Yeah, Rambo
They begging for mercy like the Lambo
Know they told me, "Kill them all," goddamn though
I know they want to see me fall, look where I am though
On two feet, that's where I stand though
I'm a true fucking killer like Rambo
No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga, I just kill 'em because I can though


I'm as humble as they come, but you fucking with the wrong one
Boy you fucking with the wrong one
This that new Pen Griffey, watch that nigga get a home run
Watch him hit it, that's a home run
I ain't playin' wit' you niggas, I'm a true Louis Villain
I'm the realest, they acrylic, fuck them niggas if they doubt it
Say I'm flippin' up, but so is a money counter
I've been getting up, 'bout to pay my self allowance
And I save it like the bell, I can't take no more L's
The day I sell my soul, that's the day I go to hell
Been putting on a show, just like Dave, I'm Chappelle
They ain't make it in the credits, I'ma tell them, "Oh well"
Tell Steve, don't let no more bitches in the hotel
Niggas gotta get to work, girl, unless you gon' twerk something
While I lay this verse on 'em
Damn, this lifestyle got a lot of perks on it
I'm just saying nigga (Young Tiller)






Yeah, Rambo
They begging for mercy like the Lambo
Know they told me, "Kill them all," goddamn though
I know they want to see me fall, look where I am though
On two feet, that's where I stand though
I'm a true fucking killer, like Rambo
No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga, I just kill 'em because I can though




This ain't temporary, I've been out here letting them know
New cat, years later, bet Sylvester Stallone
I've been working hard, I've been doing better, ya know
Peep the freeloaders, we won't be breaking bread with them, no
She chose me over him, cause he was so regular, oh
He was so regular, I'm like a butler getting his dough
I'm like a monster, or a motherfucking Predator
Oh-na-na-na, Soldier like Contra
I don't fuck with thotties, I pass her to my partner
All gold everything, bitch I'm Fort Knoxin'
New sports car, man, I'm new Porsche coppin'
Two-door, hop in, girl you know how I spend
And I been tryna budget my checks and the rest of my money, money
Rubber bands getting stretched with the hundreds, hundreds
M.V.P upper deck with the money, money
Don't I make the haters upset with the money
Bitch, I'm coming cause

For real though, it's so wild now
This shit crazy yeah




Woke up in the hills this morning
Asking myself, how did I get here this morning?
'Vante Parker in that teal and orange
And Russell in that gold and purple
Youngest from the Ville, important
I used to sit up in my room and ponder
Finished school and get a Doctors
I'm twenty-two, I gotta get it now
Man who knew he'd have it figured out?
Trapsoul, man, I crack codes
Crack cocaine, that's what we putting out
These fuck niggas saying
Don't forget when you was broke, I was looking out
And some say there's levels to this shit
Damn look at all the levels that I skipped
Feeling like there's a medal I should get
All these haters getting heavy on my dick
Look at my niggas, chasing paper
Getting books with my niggas
So how the fuck can people back home say I shook on my niggas?
Your two cents ain't working for me
All you niggas sound commercial to me, man
I don't like commercial niggas
Please shut the fuck up before I hurt you
(Fuck your feelings)
Don't take it personal (it's nothing personal)
This a Derby City come up, this a Derby City vertical
First 48, straight murder you

Louis slugger with the hits
Knock them out the park then I'm knocking down your bitch
I'm watching how you pitch
I'm not from Houston, no, I'm not from 'round the six
Got the four series, I should cop the six after the World Series
I just talked to Rich 'bout palm trees and bad bitches
And how these snakes can harm me with bad business
Damn, fuck out of here, nigga
It's very rare for young black men to come up out of here, nigga
Some will call it luck and some will call me up
I ain't heard from you in years
Please get the fuck out my ear, nigga
My peers get it
Only G-O-D can judge me, fuck the jurisdiction
I'm working, ain't got time for thirsting
Over how these chicks appear in pictures
I'm just painting crystal-clear pictures
Brushing up on my lyrics nigga
I just wish momma was here to live up under chandeliers with us
I guess all I ever had to do was take this shit a little more serious
Let's get it


There's not much to say
Woah, I'm from the Southside

Fight!
Hey

Now you done switched up on me
Now you wanna say "What's up?" to me
Okay, so now you wanna make love to me




Girl if you don't get the fuck from me

But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me




Just be honest, girl, what you want from me?
This ain't nothin' new, keep it so 100
I can't let none of these niggas get one up on me
I go by Gawd Tiller, you better run from me
Give hope to my niggas, them niggas love money
Adios to them bitches, can't get a hug from me
I'm high on life, that's what it does for me
My numbers goin' up, I feel a buzz comin' (One up)




Young nigga, young nigga

But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me

Say you lovesick, girl I got the remedy
I'll give you long dick and longevity
Don't settle for less or for infidelity
Niggas ain't built like me
He can't bag and pipe and leave that pussy killed like me
Or even keep the business behind his lips like me
I got a hundred fuckin' problems
Good brain, am I fuckin' with a scholar?
Woodgrain, I'ma grip it when I whip it
If I take a shot and brick it, I'ma flip it
Thankful for my papa, nigga taught me how to get it
Gotta make sure my brothers is eating, I'ma split it
If she throw that pussy at me I'ma hit it
Pen Griffey, but she won't get a penny, no

The way we fell in love, it was almost instant (Oh, girl)
I'm tryna find a way around it (Oh, girl)
Girl, tell me how you feel about it (Oh, girl)
You still love me, that's the way it's sounding (Oh, thank God)
Thank God, I would've never found this, I doubt it
I'm there for you if you allow it (If you allow it)
Girl, you know I gotta keep you around me (You around me)
All this paper we counting, blazing these ounces
Spending on you, baby, no matter what the amount is
Now you wanna know what's gotten into me, what's changed? (Changed, Young Tiller)
I guess I had a hard time showing it at first, but


Baby, it's been that way (Ayy, oh yeah)
Baby, it's been that way (Ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
Baby, I still feel the same (I still feel the same)
Something I gotta maintain (Something I gotta maintain)

Like I'm the one to blame and you're innocent
I tried to make a way, make a difference, but (Yeah)
Some things don't change, I can't complain (Oh)

Could it be you calling me down, down, down, down, down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else, and you're putting this all on me, forgive me


There's a time and a place for all this
This is not the place for all this
Is there a reason why you're saying all this?
And can we talk about it later?
I've gotta right my wrongs
With you is where I belong
You've been down from the go, recognition is what you want
And it's something that I should know

Feels like you don't got me so you feel like you've been by yourself
I've been feeling kinda down myself
