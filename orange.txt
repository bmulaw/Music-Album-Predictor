A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour


When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?


Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)


Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)


No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though


I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?


Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)


Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)


Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)?
How you feel (how you feel)?
You know you were my first time (time).
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul,
Not in my spirit, keep it alive (spirit, keep it alive)
We'll go down this road
'Til it turns from color to black and white


Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)


Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)














The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill


Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches and limes, the sweet life


Sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie


You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The sunshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life


The best song wasn't the single, but you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave


But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free, my tv ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches and lime, a sweet life


A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life


You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born, yeah
The sunshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach


And the water, is exactly what I wanted
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy


You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The sunshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life














I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on


My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump, you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump


I know you Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff, and so strong
I'm nervous Forrest


Forrest Gump
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump


I saw your game, Forrest
I was screamin' run 44
But you kept runnin' past the end zone
Oh where'd you go Forrest


Forrest Gump
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump


Forrest green
Forrest blues
I'm rememberin' you
If this is love, I know it's true
I won't forget you (you)
(You you, oh you you) It's for you Forrest
(You you, oh you you) It's for you Forrest
Forrest Gump








Big full breasts on my baby (Yo we goin' to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weight the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been goin' to work
Boss ain't workin' you like this
He can't take care of you like this




Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost




Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weight the work I got on your girl (Too weird to live, too weird to die)
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
No, have I ever
Have I ever let you get caught?






She's at a stove (Who?)
Can't believe I got her out here cookin' dope (Cookin' dope)
I promise she'll be
Whippin' meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothin' wrong (Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
No nothin' wrong with a lie
Nothin' wrong with another short plane ride
(Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)




Love lost?
Love love
Love lost?
Love love
Love lost
Love love
Love lost


Faith is the substance
Then the other channel on the...




Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?
He said "allahu akbar", I told him don't curse me
"But boy you need prayer", I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion




This unrequited love
To me it's nothing but
A one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love, love...




Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
And you say "allahu akbar", I told him don't curse me
"But boy you need prayer", I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion




This unrequited love
To me it's nothing but
A one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
No, no


It's a bad religion
To be in love with someone
Who could never love you
Only bad
Only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do




Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands


There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' me this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see
