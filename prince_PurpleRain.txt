I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted one time to see you laughing
I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain


Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain


I only want to see you bathing in the purple rain


I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend
Baby, I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end


Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain


I only want to see you underneath the purple rain


Honey I know, I know, I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out for something new
That means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain


Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain


If you know what I'm singing about up here
C'mon, raise your hand


Purple rain, purple rain


I only want to see you, only want to see you
In the purple rain












Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called life


Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The afterworld


A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night


So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby


'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own


And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy - punch a higher floor


If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends


You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
"Uh uh" was all I heard


Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!


Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!


We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die


And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for (what's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door


Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!


Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!


C'mon baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah


Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!
Go crazy


I said let's go crazy (go crazy)
Let's go, let's go
Go
Let's go


Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough, children


He's coming
He's coming
Coming


Take me away!
I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said how'd you like to waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind


She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind


Nikki


The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind


Darlin' Nikki


Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind


Oh, Nikki, ohhhh


Come back Nikki, come back
Your dirty little Prince
Wanna grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind




"Hello, how are you? I'm fine. 'cause I know
That the Lord is coming soon, coming, coming soon."


Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?


Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you


How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry


Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride


How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry


How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold)
Maybe you're just too demanding (Maybe, maybe I'm like my father)
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold (Ya know he's too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (Why do we scream, why)
This is what it sounds like


When doves cry
When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)
When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)


Don't Cry (Don't Cry)


When doves cry
When doves cry
When doves cry


When Doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry, doves cry
Don't cry
Darling don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't don't cry
























I'm not a woman
I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand


I'll never beat you
I'll never lie
And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by


You, I would die for you, yeah
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you


I'm not your lover
I'm not your friend
I am something that you'll never comprehend


No need to worry
No need to cry
I'm your messiah and you're the reason why


'Cause you, I would die for you, yeah
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you


You're just a sinner I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad


I'm not a human
I am a dove
I'm your conscious
I am love
All I really need is to know that
You believe


Yeah, I would die for you, yeah
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you


Yeah, say one more time


You, I would die for you
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you
2 3 4 You


I would die for you
I would die for you
You, I would die for you
You, I would die for you
